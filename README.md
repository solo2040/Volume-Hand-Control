# Volume-Hand-Control
"""
This project takes advantage of opencv-Python and mediapipe to relay coordinates of 21 different points on a hand using computer vision.
It then takes the top point of a persons pointer finger and thumb, finds the distance between the two, and translates that to a precentage that can then change the
volume of the users device.
